## Generating a Vault File

Use the included node script to generate your own encrypted vault file:

node src/scripts/generate-vault.js
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Specify your JSON password file
2. Enter a master password for encryption

## Vault File Format

The JSON format for the password file should be:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "createdAt": "2023-05-16T12:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2023-05-16T12:00:00.000Z",
    "name": "My Passwords"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "site_name": "Example",
      "site_url": "https://example.com",
      "username": "user@example.com",
      "password": "securepassword123",
      "notes": "Optional notes"
    }
  ]
}
```

Or as a simple array:

```json
[
  {
    "site_name": "Example",
    "site_url": "https://example.com",
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }
]
```
